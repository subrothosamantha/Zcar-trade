So this is a project created by me subrotho
basically its a project using native html,bootstrap, and js, also uses some of jQuery topcis 
just to give some after effects and catching some buttons.

So, project is about a craTrade its a showcase of the cars to buy, 
I have projected bootstrap Navbar and a small discription on it that will appear after some seconds using jQuery show() method, then used Bootstrap awasome feature called Carousel to desmosntrate the cars in a bigger format.

Then I used a container inside it I placed a NavTab bars by pressing that navtab we,I'll be able to navigate to perticular type of car example saden, suv, muv , etc, and this type of car data is fetching from json file the topic that I learned from JavaScript tutorial, (I could have implemented in same page but I thought of doing it most dynamically) in real time this json can also be fetch data from any database and admin can update all the car information in database only.

later the next part is using crausel to demonstrate the different brands that are available in our site so that we the data again comming from json file here and I took help from internet to implement this.

The last part is footer page thats been implemented!!!.

All the code and methods that I wrote in this project is completly my myself took some help from carDekho.com to see and understand how that website is being developed.
